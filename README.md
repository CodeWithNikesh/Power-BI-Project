Summary:

I created a Power BI dashboard using election data from both 2014 and 2019. Here's what I did:

Data Used: I used information from the elections held in 2014 and 2019.
Visualizations:
Bar Charts: Made bar charts showing how much of the total vote BJP, Congress, and other parties got in both 2014 and 2019. This helps see which party got more support in each year.
BJP's Seats: Created a chart to see how many seats BJP won in both 2014 and 2019. This helps to understand BJP's performance across the two elections.
Detailed Table: Designed a table listing election year, political party, PC (Parliamentary Constituency) name, winning candidate name, and margin of victory. This table gives a complete picture of election results, including winner details and how close the races were.
Overall, the Power BI dashboard provides a simple yet comprehensive look at the election data, allowing users to compare party performances, track BJP's seat wins, and delve into detailed election outcomes.
